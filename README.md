# Ceres

## About
Ceres is a database system designed to allow for the storage and retrieval of semi-structured data. I.e. one that conforms to a "top-level schema" where columns types are known, but those columns can in-turn contain dictionaries or lists.

### Naming
Ceres is named after the Roman goddess of agriculture for the way in which the system "harvests" data from the files it is stored on
